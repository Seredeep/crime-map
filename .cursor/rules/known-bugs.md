### Incident Modal State Persistence Bug
**Status:** Open - CLAR-72
**Priority:** High
**Affects:** Incident list modal functionality

**Description:**
When clicking "ver m√°s" on an incident, the modal opens correctly. However, after closing the modal, the incident remains visually "selected" and other incidents disappear from view. They only reappear after reopening and closing the modal again.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to incident list
2. Click "ver m√°s" on any incident
3. Modal opens correctly
4. Close the modal
5. **Bug:** Incident remains visually selected, other incidents disappear
6. **Workaround:** Reopen and close modal to restore normal view

**Root Cause:**
State management issue where incident selection state is not properly reset when modal closes.

**Affected Components:**
- Incident list modal
- Incident selection state
- Incident visibility logic

**Impact:**
- Users cannot see other incidents after viewing one
- Poor user experience
- Requires workaround to restore functionality

**Notes for Developers:**
- Check modal close handlers
- Verify state cleanup on modal unmount
- Ensure incident selection state is properly reset
- Test with multiple incident types and scenarios
