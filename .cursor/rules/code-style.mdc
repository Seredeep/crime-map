# Code Style Guidelines

## Language Requirements

- **All code must be written in English**: This includes variable names, function names, class names, comments, and documentation
- **Comments must be in English**: Even if the user communicates in Spanish, all code comments should be written in English
- **User communication**: While users may ask questions in Spanish and receive Spanish responses in chat, every piece of code output must be in English

## Localization

- **No hardcoded user-facing text**: This project uses localization, so any text that will be displayed to users should never be hardcoded in the source code
- **Use localization references**: Instead of hardcoded strings, create or update entries in the localization files (`messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`, etc.) and reference them in the code
- **Localization file updates**: When adding new user-facing text, update the appropriate localization files and use the localization key in the component/code
