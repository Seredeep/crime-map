    "description": "When clicking 'ver m√°s' on an incident, the modal opens correctly. However, after closing the modal, the incident remains visually 'selected' and other incidents disappear from view. They only reappear after reopening and closing the modal again. This suggests a state management issue where the incident selection state is not being properly reset when the modal closes."
